"You say the slot time narrowing down the delivery time to a 4 hour window is texted to you in advance so you can get an idea of when it will be.   However, if the delivery is  scheduled for 1st delivery in the morning (8:00am) you do  not get the text before the delivery.
I originally ordered a delivery for a Thursday but then had a change of plans so that I could not be available for the whole day.  I phoned up to try to move the delivery to another day when I could be available the whole day, but they said they could not do this and to wait until I got the text confirming the time of delivery so that I could find out whether I would be available or not.  The delivery arrived before the text and I was not available.  They took it away again and I was able to arrange a new date when I could be in all day - this time I did receive the text in the morning giving the slot later in the day, and the item was delivered in that time slot.
